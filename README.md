# MyLearnings

This repository contains programs that I created while taking a course on Data Structures and Algorithms on Udemy. The programs demonstrate my understanding and implementation of various data structures and algorithms, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting, and searching.

## Installation

To run the programs in this repository, you will need a C compiler installed on your local machine. You can download and install a C compiler from the [GNU website](https://gcc.gnu.org/).

Once you have the compiler installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/MyLearnings.git
```

## Usage

To compile and run a program, navigate to the directory where the program is located and use the following commands:

```
gcc program.c -o program
./program
```

Replace `program.c` with the name of the program file you want to compile and run.
